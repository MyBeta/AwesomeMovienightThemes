## 1. Good Bye Lenin! (2003)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5hzmwGW4Ac

**:trophy: IMDB 7.7 :clapper: Wolfgang Becker :star2: Daniel Brühl, Katrin Saß, Chulpan Khamatova, Maria Simon, Alexander Beyer**

This tragicomedy became a smash hit earlier this century, both in Germany and in the English-speaking world. It’s the inspired story of a young man living in East Berlin whose socialist mother suffers a heart attack and slips into a coma. While she’s in an unconscious state, political events gather speed: the Berlin Wall is knocked down, the East German government is dismantled and capitalism invades from the west. Told to avoid any stress for his mum when she wakes up, Alex decides to conceal the big news. He and his sister pretend that nothing has happened, starting a bizarre effort to keep the GDR alive within the four walls of their apartment – TV news and food included.

While touching on important political and social issues, Becker constructs an elaborate and funny charade around the fall of socialism, brilliantly combining a satire of the communist state with the story of a boy’s love for his mother.

## 2. Der Untergang // Downfall (2004)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp1RXmM1-60

**:trophy: IMDB 8.2 :clapper: Oliver Hirschbiegel :star2: Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara, Corinna Harfouch, Ulrich Matthes, Juliane Köhler, Heino Ferch, Christian Berkel, Alexander Held, Matthias Habich, Thomas Kretschmann**

The last 10 days of Adolf Hitler are viewed through the eyes of his naïve last secretary Traudl Junge, thus bringing the viewer uncomfortably close to the most despicable and pathetic human in history. It’s a bold piece of film-making which necessitates repeated viewing. A suitable companion piece would be the 1984 German TV-movie ‘The Final Solution':

The Wannsee Conference’ a real-time reenactment of the starting point of the Holocaust which offers unprecedented insight into the bureaucratic workings of evil as opposed to the purely psychopathic, personal evil of Hitler. After unwillingly getting to know Hitler better, what is truly astounding and perfectly reflected in the movie, is the contempt Hitler felt for his own people. This is probably true for dictators and so-called strongmen everywhere.


## 3. Das Leben der Anderen (2006)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlWK7CHnza4

**:trophy: IMDB 8.4 :clapper: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck :star2: Ulrich Mühe, Martina Gedeck, Sebastian Koch, Ulrich Tukur**

To win the Oscar for best foreign film with a debut feature is quite astonishing, but so is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s GDR-set spy thriller, revolving around a celebrated couple from the theatre world. In his film about morality, love and trust in times of surveillance, von Donnersmarck draws the viewer ever deeper into a spiral of ethical conflicts that is hard, if not impossible, to escape. By following Stasi commissar Wiesler, who submerges himself into the “the life of others”, we witness a gradual transition from loyal regime follower to human being – a transition that challenges our common understanding of good and evil.

Straight out of film school, von Donnersmarck managed to gather an impressive ensemble of talented actors, and the result is an intensely gripping thriller of dramatic and psychological complexity, one that is equally demanding of our hearts and minds.

## 4. Der Baader-Meinhof-Komplex (2008)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IVKAAsqcrI

**:trophy: IMDB 7.4 :clapper: Uli Edel :star2: Martina Gedeck, Moritz Bleibtreu, Johanna Wokalek, Bruno Ganz**

The most entertaining and fluid of the 1970’s German terrorism subgenre is also the most recent one about a trio of radicalized activists who turn deadly: Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Esslin.

The film functions as both thriller and social drama, it offers insight into the troublesome 1970’s in Germany and it manages to keep its distance from the controversial and flawed characters in their battle against an even more reprehensible social system. This is required viewing for anyone interested in recent German history and sweeping docudramas with an attention to detail.

## 5. Gegen die Wand // Head-On (2004)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFSAAW88GcY

**:trophy: IMDB 7.9 :clapper: Fatih Akin :star2: Birol Ünel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck, Meltem Cumbul**

Cahit is a German Turk at his late 30's. He has given up with his life after his beloved wife's death, and he's living a miserable life right in the core of cocaine and excessive drinking. One night, he semi-intentionally crashes into a wall, and barely survives. At the hospital he's taken to, he meets a girl, Sibel, another German Turk who's tried to commit suicide. She's sick and tired of her family's ultra-traditional issues, and asks Cahit to carry out a white marriage with her out of the blue, so that she can become a married woman and get rid of her family's revolting pressure. Cahit is turned off by the idea at first, but then he agrees to take part in this plan. As Sibel tells him straightaway that she's interested in absolute freedom involving other men and he agrees, they live as roommates with separate private lives for a while. Then things take a different turn, and they're no longer two indifferent roommates. But their love story won't be anywhere as simple as any other...

## 6. Toni Erdmann (2016)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uwi5EPnpA

**:trophy: IMDB 7.4 :clapper: Maren Ade :star2: Sandra Hüller, Peter Simonischek, Michael Wittenborn**

Winfried doesn’t see much of his working daughter Ines. The suddenly student-less music teacher decides to surprise her with a visit after the death of his old dog. It’s an awkward move because serious career woman Ines is working on an important project as a corporate strategist in Bucharest. The geographical change doesn’t help the two to see more eye to eye.

In all the madness, Ines begins to understand that her eccentric father might deserve some place in her life after all..

## 7. Lola Rennt // Run Lola Run (1998)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppeZQ8inevE

**:trophy: IMDB 7.6 :clapper: Tom Tykwer :star2: Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Herbert Knaup, Nina Petri, Joachim Król, Armin Rohde, Heino Ferch, Suzanne von Borsody, Sebastian Schipper**

A teenager movie more than anything else, it offers all the cheap visual thrills one might imagine (kinetic animation, black and white flashbacks, fast forwards etc) while being the perfect homage to the MTV-generation of the 90’s. The story involves doomed patsy Manni who manages to misplace a bag of money in the subway and his vermilion-haired lover and would-be savior Lola, who has to help him get the money back to avoid retribution.

The movie plays out in three alternate versions of the same story (think Groundhog Day on steroids), all dependant on split-second decisions which crucially alter the characters’ destiny. Peppered by philosophical interludes disguised as flashbacks and held together by Lola’s constant running through the streets of Berlin, the movie manages to pack a wallop of sensory stimuli in its brief 81 minutes of running time.

## 8. Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei // The Edukators (2004)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB1UMfC8koc

**:trophy: IMDB 7.5 :clapper: Hans Weingartner :star2:  Daniel Brühl, Julia Jentsch, Stipe Erceg, Burghart Klaußner**

This is a provocative movie about generational conflict, focusing on young people who are fighting against capitalism in a very distinctive way. Jan, Peter and Jule break into rich people’s houses while the owners are gone, carefully rearranging their possessions and leaving behind a note that their days of plenty are numbered. When they get caught in the act, they have no choice but to kidnap the homeowner. The slow falling apart of their idealistic worldview begins. Shooting with a handheld camera, Hans Weingartner, a former activist himself, raises the question of how fear can limit freedom.

## 9. Das Experiment (2001)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG_xQs9_MGQ

**:trophy: IMDB 7.5 :clapper: Oliver Hirschbiegel :star2: Moritz Bleibtreu, Justus von Dohnányi, Christian Berkel, Oliver Stokowski, Andrea Sawatzki**

Tarek Fahd, a journalist, takes part in a scientific study in order to write an article about it and have some fun. It is a social experiment supposed to last two weeks inspired by the infamous real-life Stanford prison experiment from 1971, structured like a role-play: half the selected subjects are prisoners while the other half play the guards.

Human nature being what we know it to be, everything soon turns drastically violent, involving gradual mind games and a mysterious black box. Connecting everything with Germany’s dark past, the perfect casting and the actor’s sure-shot delivery makes it an eerie and timeless viewing experience, devoid of stylistic bombast.

## 10. Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage (2005)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM5A4ETW_Io

**:trophy: IMDB 7.6 :clapper:  Marc Rothemund  :star2: Julia Jentsch, Fabian Hinrichs, Alexander Held, Johanna Gastdorf**

In 1943, student activist Sophie Scholl and fellow members of the White Rose resistance group work tirelessly to distribute anti-war and anti-Nazi propapanda in Munich. During one such mission, the Gestapo take her and her brother into custody; six days later, Sophie meets her fate. 

## 11. Die Welle // The Wave (2008)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FYDF8wGn5E

**:trophy: IMDB 7.6 :clapper:  Dennis Gansel  :star2: Jürgen Vogel, Frederick Lau, Max Riemelt, Jennifer Ulrich**

 This thriller is inspired by the true story of a high school teacher in California who designed an experiment to teach his students about Nazism. Similar to the 1971 Stanford-prison-experiment - excellently depicted in another German film, Das Experiment - it powerfully portrays the horrific allure of mass movements.

It asks whether fascism could still happen in the modern world. By the end you're not so sure that it couldn't.
