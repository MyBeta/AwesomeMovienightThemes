## Elle, 2016
**:trophy: IMDB 7.2 :clapper: Paul Verhoeven :star2: Isabelle Huppert, Laurent Lafitte, Anne Consigny**

Perhaps only Paul Verhoeven would open a film mid-rape—the violent attack observed by an unimpressed green-eyed cat—and then follow up with a scene where Michèle, the rape victim, face puffy from the beating, picks up a phone and orders takeout, asking questions about the "holiday roll." She's not blasé about what happened. She's freaked out. She stuffs the dress she was wearing in the trash. She takes a bath, blood from her genital area staining the bubbles above. She does not call the police. Instead, she orders food. It's hard to picture this woman shedding a tear. Ever. The opening sequence of "Elle" is just the start of the demented and exhilarating experience that is this movie. "Elle" is a high-wire act without a net. 

## Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis, 2008
**:trophy: IMDB 7.1 :clapper: Dany Boon :star2: Kad Merad, Dany Boon, Zoé Félix**

A French public servant from Provence is banished to the far North. Strongly prejudiced against this cold and inhospitable place, he leaves his family behind to relocate temporarily there, with the firm intent to quickly come back.

## Intouchables (2011)
**:trophy: IMDB 8.5 :clapper: Olivier Nakache, Éric Toledano :star2: François Cluzet, Omar Sy, Anne Le Ny**

After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caregiver.

## Amélie, 2001
**:trophy: IMDB 8.3 :clapper: Jean-Pierre Jeunet :star2: Audrey Tautou, Mathieu Kassovitz, Rufus**

The rare foreign film that actually found the American audience it deserved, Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s “Amélie” has become a bonafide sensation for good reason (it even inspired a short-lived Broadway musical). Of course the popularity and the sheer charm of this endlessly inventive 2001 rom-com have made it tempting to assume that the movie isn’t as much of an accomplishment as it might have seemed at the time, but a revisit confirms that it holds up and then some. The sweetest and most sure-handed thing that Jeunet has ever made, “Amélie” is more than just the dazzlingly stylish story of a pixie-like Montmartre waitress (or the breakout role of a lifetime for Audrey Tautou), it’s a humane and enduringly relevant portrait of a person who loves people but can’t quite bring herself to join them. She’s the perfect heroine for the internet age that she just barely anticipated, a woman who gets involved in everyone else’s business but lives her own life from a safe distance. Her journey from fantasy to reality is as full and heartwarming and brave as ever. — DE

## Holy Motors (2012)
**:trophy: IMDB 7.1 :clapper: Leos Carax :star2: Denis Lavant, Edith Scob, Eva Mendes**

He seems to be playing roles, plunging headlong into each part - but where are the cameras? Monsieur Oscar is alone, accompanied only by Céline, the slender blonde woman behind the wheel of the vast engine that transports him through and around Paris. He's like a conscientious assassin moving from hit to hit. In pursuit of the beautiful gesture, the mysterious driving force, the women and the ghosts of past lives. But where is his true home, his family, his rest?

## Caché (2005)
**:trophy: IMDB 7.3 :clapper: Michael Haneke :star2: Daniel Auteuil, Juliette Binoche, Maurice Bénichou**

Paranoia grips a bourgeois European family when a series of menacing videotapes begin turning up on their doorstep in Piano Teacher director Michael Haneke's dark drama. From the outside, Georges (Daniel Auteuil), Anne (Juliette Binoche), and son Pierrot (Lester Makedonsky) are the typical middle-class European family, but when a series of mysterious videotapes accompanied by morbid drawings reveal that someone has been monitoring their house, Georges begins to suspect that his past has come back to haunt him. It was during France's occupation of Algeria that Georges wronged a young Algerian boy named Majid (Maurice Bénichou), and as the enraged father and husband begins tracking down his former friend, the line between victim and predator becomes increasingly blurred.

## La pianiste (2001)
**:trophy: IMDB 7.5 :clapper: Michael Haneke :star2: Isabelle Huppert, Annie Girardot, Benoît Magimel**

Erika Kohut is a piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory prestigious music school in Vienna. In her early forties and single, she lives with her overprotective and controlling mother in a hermetically sealed world of love-hate and dependency, where there is no room for men. Her sex life consists of voyeurism and masochistic self-injury. Lonely and alienated, Erika finds solace by visiting sex shops and experimenting with masochism. Ata a recital, she befriends Walter, a handsome young man, whom she seduces and with whom she begins an illicit affair. As Erika slowly drifts closer to the brink of emotional disorder, she uses the love-stricken Walter to explore her darkest sado-masochistic fantasies, which eventually lead to her undoing.

## Tomboy (2011)
**:trophy: IMDB 7.4 :clapper: Céline Sciamma :star2: Zoé Héran, Malonn Lévana, Jeanne Disson**

A French family with two daughters, 10-year-old Laure and 6-year-old Jeanne, moves to a new neighborhood during the summer holidays. With her Jean Seberg haircut and tomboy ways, Laure is immediately mistaken for a boy by the local kids and passes herself off as Michael. Filmmaker Céline Sciamma brings a light and charming touch to this drama of childhood gender confusion. Zoe Heran as Laure/Michael and Malonn Levanna as Jeanne are nothing less than brilliant. This is a relationship movie: relationships between children, and the even more complicated one between one's heart and body. 
One of the few truly perfect films of the 21st Century, Céline Sciamma’s “Tomboy” is a succinct and unforgettable look at the purity and confusion of growing up. Crucially, it’s also one of the most forthright and empathetic movies we have about gender identity in the modern sense. Starring Zoé Héran as an androgynous-looking kid named Laure who’s given a blank slate on which to draw their own identity when their family moves to a new housing bloc, “Tomboy” needs only 82 minutes to offer a moving, organic, and remarkably humane narrative about the relationship between sex and gender, and also between gender and identity. Laure keeps their anatomy like a secret, but in doing so reveals volumes of truth regarding how little it matters. — DE

## La vie d'Adèle (2013)
**:trophy: IMDB 7.8 :clapper: Abdellatif Kechiche :star2: Léa Seydoux, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Salim Kechiouche**

The first sex scene in “Blue Is the Warmest Color,” Abdellatif Kechiche’s French coming-of-age drama about a young lesbian couple, lasts longer than any other sequence in the movie. To dwell on its length, however, shortchanges its relevance to this three-hour-long feature. After a brief heterosexual relationship in which she loses her virginity, 15-year-old Adéle (Adéle Exarchopoulos) falls hard for chic art student Emma (Léa Seydoux), and the moment they get the chance to take their clothes off the passion explodes. The graphic moment — the subject of much controversy for this male-directed story — enhances the heartbreak of watching their union collapse later on. Exarchopoulos delivers a bold performance in her breakthrough role at the movie’s center, portraying her character as a woman trapped by the mixed messages around her. Seydoux, barely recognizable during the first half under a mop of blue-dyed hair, perfectly embodies the freewheeling mentality that offers Adéle an escape from her staid existence. The director has crafted such a believable world that it’s hard not to get wrapped up in the stakes at hand. The sex is less the main ingredient in “Blue is the Warmest Color” than it is a starting point for exploring how physicality impacts romantic maturity. The movie elegantly tussles with the idea of reconciling desire with other factors in the cultivation of healthy companionship, but leaves the solution to that challenge in an unfinished stage. It’s a love story for the ages. —EK
