Royal Tenenbaum and his wife, Etheline, had three children—Chas, Margot, and Richie—and then they separated. Chas started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance. Margot was a playwright and received a Braverman Grant of $50,000 in the ninth grade. Richie was a junior champion tennis player and won the U.S. Nationals three years in a row. Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. The Royal Tenenbaums is a hilarious, touching, and brilliantly stylized study of melancholy and redemption from Wes Anderson.

## 2. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)

:star2: **Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Saoirse Ronan, Jason Schwartzman, Léa Seydoux, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Tony Revolori**

The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the back-drop ofa suddenly and dramatically changing Continent.

## 3. Rushmore (1998)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZVdXXG3KN8

:star2: **Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, Bill Murray**

The dazzling sophomore film from Wes Anderson is equal parts coming-of-age story, French New Wave homage, and screwball comedy. Tenth grader Max Fischer is Rushmore Academy’s most extracurricular student—and its least scholarly. He faces expulsion and enters into unlikely friendships with both a lovely first-grade teacher and a melancholy self-made millionaire. Set to a soundtrack of classic British Invasion tunes, Rushmore defies categorization, capturing the pain and exuberance of adolescence with wit, emotional depth, and cinematic panache.

## 4. Fantastic Mr Fox (2009)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2igjYFojUo

:star2: (animated) **George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Bill Murray**

Fantastic Mr. Fox is the story of a clever, quick, nimble, and exceptionally well-dressed wild animal. A compulsive chicken thief turned newspaper reporter, Mr. Fox settles down with his family in a new foxhole in a beautiful tree—directly adjacent to three enormous poultry farms owned by three ferociously vicious farmers: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. Mr. Fox simply cannot resist. Wes Anderson’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s novel is a meticulous work of stop-motion animation.

## 5. Moonrise Kingdom (2012)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eOI3AamSm8

:star2: **Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Bob Balaban**

This coming-of-age tale about kids attending a scouting camp does something interesting that few on-screen love stories do. It tells the parallel stories of a pair of bright-eyes tweens falling in love and an old married couple falling out of love, tackling the full spectrum of romance in a way that few romantic movies manage to do.

Anderson’s trademark use of symmetry in his cinematic composition is on point here, and his personal stamp can be spotted in every scene, line of dialogue, and character moment. This is the work of a filmmaker at the height of his powers, for better or for worse.

## 6. Isle of Dogs (2018)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt__kig8PVU

:star2: (animated) **Koyu Rankin, Liev Schreiber, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, Greta Gerwig, Yoko Ono**

Say “Isle of Dogs” fast and it comes out sounding an awful lot like “I Love Dogs” — which makes sense, since that’s pretty much the chief takeaway from Wes Anderson’s delightful new animated feature. A winningly dippy hodgepooch of lo-fi sci-fi, band-of-outsiders adventure and the most meme-ready canine antics you’ll find outside of YouTube, this leisurely tale of abandoned mutts taking on a corrupt human government is effectively puppy-treat cinema: small, salty, perhaps not an entire meal, but rewarding nonetheless.

More than any part of its slender, precarious narrative, “Isle of Dogs” is really a film about its own enthusiasms: for four-legged fleabags of all shapes and sizes, of course, but also for the culture and cinema of Japan, which is woven with typical fastidiousness into Anderson’s magpie aesthetic. That makes it a markedly more eccentric proposition than Anderson’s first feature-length foray into stop-motion, 2009’s “Fantastic Mr. Fox” — and with a PG-13 rating for its dry adult comedy, mostly played in a limbo-low key, a niche commercial prospect, too. The Anderson faithful will be tickled pink as a newborn pup, as will voters for year-end animation awards; the palpable spirit of affection driving proceedings, meanwhile, will have to be the film’s chief defense against charges of cultural appropriation.

## 7. Hotel Chevalier (2007)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUBm1M4WTM

:star2: **Jason Schwartzman, Natalie Portman**

It’s only 13 minutes long but Anderson’s single-location two-hander – ostensibly a warmup for The Darjeeling Limited – proves that he can do perfectly well without the bells and whistles, perhaps better. There’s practically nothing to it: Jason Schwartzman is holed up in an expensive Paris hotel room; Natalie Portman visits for a last goodbye. Peter Sarstedt’s Where Do You Go (To My Lovely)? plays on the iPod. But this minimal story captures a moment, and there’s a sense of what went before – and what will come after. He should do more like it.

## 10. The Darjeeling Limited (2007)
:clapper: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO1bYukdvLI 

:star2: **Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman, and Anjelica Huston**

In director Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited, three estranged American brothers reunite for a meticulously planned, soul-searching train voyage across India one year after the death of their father. Armed with eleven suitcases, a laminated itinerary, a can of pepper spray, a supply of over-the-counter painkillers, and a host of family conflicts ready to erupt, Francis, Peter, and Jack eventually find themselves stranded alone in the middle of the desert—at which point an unexpected new chapter in their journey begins. The Darjeeling Limited is a dazzling and hilarious film that takes Anderson’s work to deeper places than ever before.
